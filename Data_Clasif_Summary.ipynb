              "1                           I’ve been a user since it’s initial roll out and have been waiting for a mobile application ever since using the web app. For reference  I’m a software engineering student while working in IT full time. I have to say GPT is an crucial tool. It takes far less time to get information quickly that you’d otherwise have to source from stack-overflow, various red-hat articles, Ubuntu articles, searching through software documentation, Microsoft documentation ect. Typically chat gpt can find the answer in a fraction of a second that google can. Obviously it is wrong, a lot. But to have the ability to get quick information on my phone like I can in the web browser I’m super excited about and have already been using the mobile app since download constantly. And I’m excited for the future of this program becoming more accurate and it seems to be getting more and more precise with every roll out. Gone are the days scouring the internet for obscure pieces of information, chat gpt can find it for you with 2 or 3 prompts. I love this app and I’m so happy it’s on mobile now. The UI is also very sleek, easy to use. My only complaint with the interface is the history tab at the top right. I actually prefer the conversation tabs on the left in the web app but I understand it would make the app kind of clunky especially on mobile since the screen size is smaller. Anyway, awesome app 5 stars.   \n",
              "2                                This app would almost be perfect if it wasn’t for ONE little thing: a “search in” function. As anyone can imagine, these AI chats can get quuuuite long, and quite lengthy. And sometimes I wanna go into a chat & look up a specific part or parts of that particular chat by using a search function to look up key words within that chat & track down whatever part I was looking for. For example, in a chat, if I had searched way early into the chat “how do lions hunt?” And say days later, I wanted to revisit that particular response, I wanna be able to go into the actual chat go to a “search in” function and be able to type in key words like “lions” or “hunt” to be able to automatically find that part in the chat instead of having to scroll through a massive chat to find that part. Similar to what you can do in Microsoft Word docs, or even on web browsers. I think the app already kind of has this, but it doesn’t work exactly like that. I tested it out, and all it does is, you type in key words, and it shows you that those words are present in the chat or chats, but it doesn’t actually track it down or take you to that specific part. If this app can have that? It’s an absolute massive perfect winner. Addendum - I also noticed that my phone (iPhone 14 Pro Max) tends to run a little hotter, which I’m sure will affect battery life, when using the app. Just wanted to add that too.   \n",
              "3  I recently downloaded the app and overall, it's a great platform with excellent potential. However, I did encounter a couple of issues with logging in that I feel need to be addressed. Firstly, the login process was somewhat cumbersome. It took me a few attempts to successfully log in, as the app didn't always recognize my credentials right away. This could be improved by streamlining the login flow and ensuring a smoother user experience. Secondly, the app occasionally experienced login glitches, where it would unexpectedly log me out without any apparent reason. It was frustrating to have to re-enter my login information repeatedly, disrupting my usage. Despite these issues, I must say that once I managed to log in successfully, the app itself was fantastic. It offers a wide range of features and a sleek user interface that is visually appealing. The content available on the platform is diverse and engaging, keeping me entertained for hours. I do hope the developers take note of the login challenges and work on improving this aspect of the app. With a more reliable login system, this app has the potential to become a top-tier platform. In conclusion, while the app has its share of login issues, it still holds promise. I'm optimistic that with some updates and improvements, it can provide an even better user experience. I look forward to seeing future enhancements and continued growth of the app.   \n",
              "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I appreciate the devs implementing Siri support—it is already enhancing the usefulness of the app, despite being a little clunky. I’d prefer if it were possible to make a query in one fell swoop, however. Currently, it seems like I have to say “ask ChatGPT” then wait to be asked what my query is before saying the actual query. I know that it’s possible in other contexts to submit a request to a third-party app through Siri in a single query—I’m able to say “Create a reminder for XYZ in Things,” for example. \\n\\nIn addition, the responses produced when querying Siri seem identical to those you would get in-app. This isn’t actually ideal in a scenario when you’re getting a spoken response—they just go on for way too long. I wonder if the app could be smart enough to recognize that a request was coming via Siri and then effectively append an invisible “Please answer in less than 50 words” to those requests. \\n\\nOtherwise, a solid but basic chat app that closely replicates the web experience. Aside from being uncannily good at punctuating my speech, the dictation feature is not really any different to iOS’s stock dictation and is not all that useful.   \n",

However, I did encounter a couple of issues with logging in that I feel need to be addressed. Firstly, the login process was somewhat cumbersome. It took me a few attempts to successfully log in, as the app didn't always recognize my credentials right away. This could be improved by streamlining the login flow and ensuring a smoother user experience. Secondly, the app occasionally experienced login glitches, where it would unexpectedly log me out without any apparent reason. It was frustrating to have to re-enter my login information repeatedly, disrupting my usage. Despite these issues, I must say that once I managed to log in successfully, the app itself was fantastic. It offers a wide range of features and a sleek user interface that is visually appealing. The content available on the platform is diverse and engaging, keeping me entertained for hours. I do hope the developers take note of the login challenges and work on improving this aspect of the app. With a more reliable login system, this app has the potential to become a top-tier platform. In conclusion, while the app has its share of login issues, it still holds promise. I'm optimistic that with some updates and improvements, it can provide an even better user experience. I look forward to seeing future enhancements and continued growth of the app.</td>\n",

              "      <td>I appreciate the devs implementing Siri support—it is already enhancing the usefulness of the app, despite being a little clunky. I’d prefer if it were possible to make a query in one fell swoop, however. Currently, it seems like I have to say “ask ChatGPT” then wait to be asked what my query is before saying the actual query. I know that it’s possible in other contexts to submit a request to a third-party app through Siri in a single query—I’m able to say “Create a reminder for XYZ in Things,” for example. \\n\\nIn addition, the responses produced when querying Siri seem identical to those you would get in-app. This isn’t actually ideal in a scenario when you’re getting a spoken response—they just go on for way too long. I wonder if the app could be smart enough to recognize that a request was coming via Siri and then effectively append an invisible “Please answer in less than 50 words” to those requests. \\n\\nOtherwise, a solid but basic chat app that closely replicates the web experience. Aside from being uncannily good at punctuating my speech, the dictation feature is not really any different to iOS’s stock dictation and is not all that useful.</td>\n",

While it’s doable, screen reader navigation is pretty difficult on the desktop site and you really have to be an advanced user to find your way through it. I have submitted numerous feedbacks to open AI about this but nothing has changed on that front.\\nWell, the good news – the iOS app pretty much addresses all of those problems. The UI seems really clean, uncluttered and designed well to be compatible with voiceover, the screen reader built into iOS. I applaud the inclusivity of this design – I only wish they would give the same attention and care to the accessibility experience of the desktop app.\\nI would have given this review five stars but I have just a couple minor quibbles. First, once I submit my prompt, voiceover starts to read aloud ChatGPT‘s response before that response is finished, so I will hear the first few words of the response followed by voiceover reading aloud the “stop generating” button, which isn’t super helpful. It would be great if you could better coordinate this alert so that it didn’t start reading the message until it had been fully generated. The other thing I’d like is a Feedback button easily accessible from within the main screen of the app, to make it as easy as possible to get continuing suggestions and feedback from your users.\\nOtherwise, fantastic app so far!\n",

However, I did encounter a couple of issues with logging in that I feel need to be addressed. Firstly, the login process was somewhat cumbersome. It took me a few attempts to successfully log in, as the app didn't always recognize my credentials right away. This could be improved by streamlining the login flow and ensuring a smoother user experience. Secondly, the app occasionally experienced login glitches, where it would unexpectedly log me out without any apparent reason. It was frustrating to have to re-enter my login information repeatedly, disrupting my usage. Despite these issues, I must say that once I managed to log in successfully, the app itself was fantastic. It offers a wide range of features and a sleek user interface that is visually appealing. The content available on the platform is diverse and engaging, keeping me entertained for hours. I do hope the developers take note of the login challenges and work on improving this aspect of the app. With a more reliable login system, this app has the potential to become a top-tier platform. In conclusion, while the app has its share of login issues, it still holds promise. I'm optimistic that with some updates and improvements, it can provide an even better user experience. I look forward to seeing future enhancements and continued growth of the app.\n",

I’d prefer if it were possible to make a query in one fell swoop, however. Currently, it seems like I have to say “ask ChatGPT” then wait to be asked what my query is before saying the actual query. I know that it’s possible in other contexts to submit a request to a third-party app through Siri in a single query—I’m able to say “Create a reminder for XYZ in Things,” for example. \\n\\nIn addition, the responses produced when querying Siri seem identical to those you would get in-app. This isn’t actually ideal in a scenario when you’re getting a spoken response—they just go on for way too long. I wonder if the app could be smart enough to recognize that a request was coming via Siri and then effectively append an invisible “Please answer in less than 50 words” to those requests. \\n\\nOtherwise, a solid but basic chat app that closely replicates the web experience. Aside from being uncannily good at punctuating my speech, the dictation feature is not really any different to iOS’s stock dictation and is not all that useful.\n",

While it’s doable, screen reader navigation is pretty difficult on the desktop site and you really have to be an advanced user to find your way through it. I have submitted numerous feedbacks to open AI about this but nothing has changed on that front.\\nWell, the good news – the iOS app pretty much addresses all of those problems. The UI seems really clean, uncluttered and designed well to be compatible with voiceover, the screen reader built into iOS. I applaud the inclusivity of this design – I only wish they would give the same attention and care to the accessibility experience of the desktop app.\\nI would have given this review five stars but I have just a couple minor quibbles. First, once I submit my prompt, voiceover starts to read aloud ChatGPT‘s response before that response is finished, so I will hear the first few words of the response followed by voiceover reading aloud the “stop generating” button, which isn’t super helpful. It would be great if you could better coordinate this alert so that it didn’t start reading the message until it had been fully generated. The other thing I’d like is a Feedback button easily accessible from within the main screen of the app, to make it as easy as possible to get continuing suggestions and feedback from your users.\\nOtherwise, fantastic app so far!</td>\n",

I have to say GPT is an crucial tool. It takes far less time to get information quickly that you’d otherwise have to source from stack-overflow, various red-hat articles, Ubuntu articles, searching through software documentation, Microsoft documentation ect. Typically chat gpt can find the answer in a fraction of a second that google can. Obviously it is wrong, a lot. But to have the ability to get quick information on my phone like I can in the web browser I’m super excited about and have already been using the mobile app since download constantly. And I’m excited for the future of this program becoming more accurate and it seems to be getting more and more precise with every roll out. Gone are the days scouring the internet for obscure pieces of information, chat gpt can find it for you with 2 or 3 prompts. I love this app and I’m so happy it’s on mobile now. The UI is also very sleek, easy to use. My only complaint with the interface is the history tab at the top right. I actually prefer the conversation tabs on the left in the web app but I understand it would make the app kind of clunky especially on mobile since the screen size is smaller. Anyway, awesome app 5 stars.</td>\n",

As anyone can imagine, these AI chats can get quuuuite long, and quite lengthy. And sometimes I wanna go into a chat &amp; look up a specific part or parts of that particular chat by using a search function to look up key words within that chat &amp; track down whatever part I was looking for. For example, in a chat, if I had searched way early into the chat “how do lions hunt?” And say days later, I wanted to revisit that particular response, I wanna be able to go into the actual chat go to a “search in” function and be able to type in key words like “lions” or “hunt” to be able to automatically find that part in the chat instead of having to scroll through a massive chat to find that part. Similar to what you can do in Microsoft Word docs, or even on web browsers. I think the app already kind of has this, but it doesn’t work exactly like that. I tested it out, and all it does is, you type in key words, and it shows you that those words are present in the chat or chats, but it doesn’t actually track it down or take you to that specific part. If this app can have that? It’s an absolute massive perfect winner. Addendum - I also noticed that my phone (iPhone 14 Pro Max) tends to run a little hotter, which I’m sure will affect battery life, when using the app. Just wanted to add that too.</td>\n",

However, I did encounter a couple of issues with logging in that I feel need to be addressed. Firstly, the login process was somewhat cumbersome. It took me a few attempts to successfully log in, as the app didn't always recognize my credentials right away. This could be improved by streamlining the login flow and ensuring a smoother user experience. Secondly, the app occasionally experienced login glitches, where it would unexpectedly log me out without any apparent reason. It was frustrating to have to re-enter my login information repeatedly, disrupting my usage. Despite these issues, I must say that once I managed to log in successfully, the app itself was fantastic. It offers a wide range of features and a sleek user interface that is visually appealing. The content available on the platform is diverse and engaging, keeping me entertained for hours. I do hope the developers take note of the login challenges and work on improving this aspect of the app. With a more reliable login system, this app has the potential to become a top-tier platform. In conclusion, while the app has its share of login issues, it still holds promise. I'm optimistic that with some updates and improvements, it can provide an even better user experience. I look forward to seeing future enhancements and continued growth of the app.</td>\n",

I’d prefer if it were possible to make a query in one fell swoop, however. Currently, it seems like I have to say “ask ChatGPT” then wait to be asked what my query is before saying the actual query. I know that it’s possible in other contexts to submit a request to a third-party app through Siri in a single query—I’m able to say “Create a reminder for XYZ in Things,” for example. \\n\\nIn addition, the responses produced when querying Siri seem identical to those you would get in-app. This isn’t actually ideal in a scenario when you’re getting a spoken response—they just go on for way too long. I wonder if the app could be smart enough to recognize that a request was coming via Siri and then effectively append an invisible “Please answer in less than 50 words” to those requests. \\n\\nOtherwise, a solid but basic chat app that closely replicates the web experience. Aside from being uncannily good at punctuating my speech, the dictation feature is not really any different to iOS’s stock dictation and is not all that useful.</td>\n",

Firstly, it would be immensely beneficial to add a browsing feature. This would enable users to quickly cross-reference information within the app, enriching the overall user experience.\\n\\nSecondly, supporting plug-ins would greatly increase the app’s versatility. It would allow users to customize their experience and adapt the app to a wider range of applications.\\n\\nLastly, incorporating a code interpreter would be a game-changer. This feature could aid users in debugging code, learning new programming languages, or even automating tasks.\\n\\nIn summary, ChatGPT is an excellent app that has revolutionized communication with AI.

It would be great if you could better coordinate this alert so that it didn’t start reading the message until it had been fully generated.

The reviewer appreciates the clean UI and compatibility with VoiceOver, showing satisfaction with the app's design.

The reviewer appreciates the app's speed and accuracy, describing it as a significant improvement over traditional information-sourcing methods.

The user is highly satisfied with the app's functionality and performance, describing it as \"almost perfect.\" However, the absence of a search function within chats is a critical drawback, as it hinders efficient navigation through lengthy conversations. The user provides a detailed explanation and comparison to existing search functionalities in other applications, highlighting its importance. Additionally, a secondary concern about increased phone temperature and potential battery impact is mentioned, though it's less central to the primary critique.

        "In the basic prompting test, the model classified each review based solely on the given text without any prior examples or contextual instructions. While the results were generally coherent, the reasoning occasionally oversimplified complex feedback. For example, Review 1 was labeled as *positive* because the model focused primarily on the compliments rather than considering the presence of mixed sentiments. Similarly, Review 3 was recognized as *mixed* but lacked nuanced justification regarding the weight of negative versus positive remarks.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, the few-shot (advanced) prompt introduced three example reviews with predefined classifications. This guided the model to better recognize the internal structure of sentiment expressions—particularly when positive and negative elements coexist. The model’s reasoning became more analytical providing balanced explanations and more accurate classifications. For instance:\n",
        "\n",
        "**- Review 1 shifted from *positive* to *mixed* because the model acknowledged both appreciation and minor criticism.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**- Review 3 shifted from *mixed* to *negative* after the model identified the reviewer’s emphasis on missing features and technical issues as dominant negative cues.**\n",
        "\n",
        "This comparison illustrates the impact of few-shot learning: **providing examples within the prompt enhances Granite’s contextual understanding, helping it weigh sentiment polarity more accurately and deliver richer, human-like justifications**.\n"

              "0     Much more accessible for blind users than the web version --- Up to this point I’ve mostly been using ChatGPT on my windows desktop using Google Chrome. While it’s doable, screen reader navigation is pretty difficult on the desktop site and you really have to be an advanced user to find your way through it. I have submitted numerous feedbacks to open AI about this but nothing has changed on that front.\\nWell, the good news – the iOS app pretty much addresses all of those problems. The UI seems really clean, uncluttered and designed well to be compatible with voiceover, the screen reader built into iOS. I applaud the inclusivity of this design – I only wish they would give the same attention and care to the accessibility experience of the desktop app.\\nI would have given this review five stars but I have just a couple minor quibbles. First, once I submit my prompt, voiceover starts to read aloud ChatGPT‘s response before that response is finished, so I will hear the first few words of the response followed by voiceover reading aloud the “stop generating” button, which isn’t super helpful. It would be great if you could better coordinate this alert so that it didn’t start reading the message until it had been fully generated. The other thing I’d like is a Feedback button easily accessible from within the main screen of the app, to make it as easy as possible to get continuing suggestions and feedback from your users.\\nOtherwise, fantastic app so far!   \n",
              "1                                           Much anticipated, wasn’t let down. --- I’ve been a user since it’s initial roll out and have been waiting for a mobile application ever since using the web app. For reference  I’m a software engineering student while working in IT full time. I have to say GPT is an crucial tool. It takes far less time to get information quickly that you’d otherwise have to source from stack-overflow, various red-hat articles, Ubuntu articles, searching through software documentation, Microsoft documentation ect. Typically chat gpt can find the answer in a fraction of a second that google can. Obviously it is wrong, a lot. But to have the ability to get quick information on my phone like I can in the web browser I’m super excited about and have already been using the mobile app since download constantly. And I’m excited for the future of this program becoming more accurate and it seems to be getting more and more precise with every roll out. Gone are the days scouring the internet for obscure pieces of information, chat gpt can find it for you with 2 or 3 prompts. I love this app and I’m so happy it’s on mobile now. The UI is also very sleek, easy to use. My only complaint with the interface is the history tab at the top right. I actually prefer the conversation tabs on the left in the web app but I understand it would make the app kind of clunky especially on mobile since the screen size is smaller. Anyway, awesome app 5 stars.   \n",
              "2                                           Almost 5 stars, but… no search function --- This app would almost be perfect if it wasn’t for ONE little thing: a “search in” function. As anyone can imagine, these AI chats can get quuuuite long, and quite lengthy. And sometimes I wanna go into a chat & look up a specific part or parts of that particular chat by using a search function to look up key words within that chat & track down whatever part I was looking for. For example, in a chat, if I had searched way early into the chat “how do lions hunt?” And say days later, I wanted to revisit that particular response, I wanna be able to go into the actual chat go to a “search in” function and be able to type in key words like “lions” or “hunt” to be able to automatically find that part in the chat instead of having to scroll through a massive chat to find that part. Similar to what you can do in Microsoft Word docs, or even on web browsers. I think the app already kind of has this, but it doesn’t work exactly like that. I tested it out, and all it does is, you type in key words, and it shows you that those words are present in the chat or chats, but it doesn’t actually track it down or take you to that specific part. If this app can have that? It’s an absolute massive perfect winner. Addendum - I also noticed that my phone (iPhone 14 Pro Max) tends to run a little hotter, which I’m sure will affect battery life, when using the app. Just wanted to add that too.   \n",
              "3                               4.5 stars, here’s why --- I recently downloaded the app and overall, it's a great platform with excellent potential. However, I did encounter a couple of issues with logging in that I feel need to be addressed. Firstly, the login process was somewhat cumbersome. It took me a few attempts to successfully log in, as the app didn't always recognize my credentials right away. This could be improved by streamlining the login flow and ensuring a smoother user experience. Secondly, the app occasionally experienced login glitches, where it would unexpectedly log me out without any apparent reason. It was frustrating to have to re-enter my login information repeatedly, disrupting my usage. Despite these issues, I must say that once I managed to log in successfully, the app itself was fantastic. It offers a wide range of features and a sleek user interface that is visually appealing. The content available on the platform is diverse and engaging, keeping me entertained for hours. I do hope the developers take note of the login challenges and work on improving this aspect of the app. With a more reliable login system, this app has the potential to become a top-tier platform. In conclusion, while the app has its share of login issues, it still holds promise. I'm optimistic that with some updates and improvements, it can provide an even better user experience. I look forward to seeing future enhancements and continued growth of the app.   \n",

I’d prefer if it were possible to make a query in one fell swoop, however. Currently, it seems like I have to say “ask ChatGPT” then wait to be asked what my query is before saying the actual query. I know that it’s possible in other contexts to submit a request to a third-party app through Siri in a single query—I’m able to say “Create a reminder for XYZ in Things,” for example. \\n\\nIn addition, the responses produced when querying Siri seem identical to those you would get in-app. This isn’t actually ideal in a scenario when you’re getting a spoken response—they just go on for way too long. I wonder if the app could be smart enough to recognize that a request was coming via Siri and then effectively append an invisible “Please answer in less than 50 words” to those requests. \\n\\nOtherwise, a solid but basic chat app that closely replicates the web experience. Aside from being uncannily good at punctuating my speech, the dictation feature is not really any different to iOS’s stock dictation and is not all that useful.   \n",

While it’s doable, screen reader navigation is pretty difficult on the desktop site and you really have to be an advanced user to find your way through it. I have submitted numerous feedbacks to open AI about this but nothing has changed on that front.\\nWell, the good news – the iOS app pretty much addresses all of those problems. The UI seems really clean, uncluttered and designed well to be compatible with voiceover, the screen reader built into iOS. I applaud the inclusivity of this design – I only wish they would give the same attention and care to the accessibility experience of the desktop app.\\nI would have given this review five stars but I have just a couple minor quibbles. First, once I submit my prompt, voiceover starts to read aloud ChatGPT‘s response before that response is finished, so I will hear the first few words of the response followed by voiceover reading aloud the “stop generating” button, which isn’t super helpful. It would be great if you could better coordinate this alert so that it didn’t start reading the message until it had been fully generated. The other thing I’d like is a Feedback button easily accessible from within the main screen of the app, to make it as easy as possible to get continuing suggestions and feedback from your users.\\nOtherwise, fantastic app so far!</td>\n",

I have to say GPT is an crucial tool. It takes far less time to get information quickly that you’d otherwise have to source from stack-overflow, various red-hat articles, Ubuntu articles, searching through software documentation, Microsoft documentation ect. Typically chat gpt can find the answer in a fraction of a second that google can. Obviously it is wrong, a lot. But to have the ability to get quick information on my phone like I can in the web browser I’m super excited about and have already been using the mobile app since download constantly. And I’m excited for the future of this program becoming more accurate and it seems to be getting more and more precise with every roll out. Gone are the days scouring the internet for obscure pieces of information, chat gpt can find it for you with 2 or 3 prompts. I love this app and I’m so happy it’s on mobile now. The UI is also very sleek, easy to use. My only complaint with the interface is the history tab at the top right. I actually prefer the conversation tabs on the left in the web app but I understand it would make the app kind of clunky especially on mobile since the screen size is smaller.

As anyone can imagine, these AI chats can get quuuuite long, and quite lengthy. And sometimes I wanna go into a chat &amp; look up a specific part or parts of that particular chat by using a search function to look up key words within that chat &amp; track down whatever part I was looking for. For example, in a chat, if I had searched way early into the chat “how do lions hunt?” And say days later, I wanted to revisit that particular response, I wanna be able to go into the actual chat go to a “search in” function and be able to type in key words like “lions” or “hunt” to be able to automatically find that part in the chat instead of having to scroll through a massive chat to find that part. Similar to what you can do in Microsoft Word docs, or even on web browsers. I think the app already kind of has this, but it doesn’t work exactly like that. I tested it out, and all it does is, you type in key words, and it shows you that those words are present in the chat or chats, but it doesn’t actually track it down or take you to that specific part. If this app can have that? It’s an absolute massive perfect winner. Addendum - I also noticed that my phone (iPhone 14 Pro Max) tends to run a little hotter, which I’m sure will affect battery life, when using the app. Just wanted to add that too.</td>\n",

However, I did encounter a couple of issues with logging in that I feel need to be addressed. Firstly, the login process was somewhat cumbersome. It took me a few attempts to successfully log in, as the app didn't always recognize my credentials right away. This could be improved by streamlining the login flow and ensuring a smoother user experience. Secondly, the app occasionally experienced login glitches, where it would unexpectedly log me out without any apparent reason. It was frustrating to have to re-enter my login information repeatedly, disrupting my usage. Despite these issues, I must say that once I managed to log in successfully, the app itself was fantastic. It offers a wide range of features and a sleek user interface that is visually appealing. The content available on the platform is diverse and engaging, keeping me entertained for hours. I do hope the developers take note of the login challenges and work on improving this aspect of the app. With a more reliable login system, this app has the potential to become a top-tier platform. In conclusion, while the app has its share of login issues, it still holds promise. I'm optimistic that with some updates and improvements, it can provide an even better user experience. I look forward to seeing future enhancements and continued growth of the app.</td>\n",

I’d prefer if it were possible to make a query in one fell swoop, however. Currently, it seems like I have to say “ask ChatGPT” then wait to be asked what my query is before saying the actual query. I know that it’s possible in other contexts to submit a request to a third-party app through Siri in a single query—I’m able to say “Create a reminder for XYZ in Things,” for example. \\n\\nIn addition, the responses produced when querying Siri seem identical to those you would get in-app. This isn’t actually ideal in a scenario when you’re getting a spoken response—they just go on for way too long. I wonder if the app could be smart enough to recognize that a request was coming via Siri and then effectively append an invisible “Please answer in less than 50 words” to those requests. \\n\\nOtherwise, a solid but basic chat app that closely replicates the web experience. Aside from being uncannily good at punctuating my speech, the dictation feature is not really any different to iOS’s stock dictation and is not all that useful.</td>\n",
